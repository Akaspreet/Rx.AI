    You need to create patient History Summary for Doctor

    Frequent Occurring Diseases:

    List diseases the patient frequently experiences based on prescription history and reported symptoms.
    Critical Diseases:

    Identify any critical conditions the patient has, noting the severity and recent occurrences.
    Prescription Adherence:

    Evaluate the adherence to prescribed medications. Compare the number of medications that should have been consumed by now versus the actual number taken. Note any discrepancies that suggest non-compliance.
    Age Group:

    Indicate if the patient belongs to an older age group, which might impact their overall health management and prescription adherence.
    Frequently Reported Symptoms:

    Summarize the symptoms that have been reported most frequently by the patient and their recent trends.
    Criticality Flag:

    Highlight any critical issues based on the severity of diseases, non-compliance with prescriptions, or other significant health indicators.
    Example Analysis:

    Diseases: The patient frequently reports hypertension and diabetes. Hypertension was noted in recent visits and is considered critical due to its impact on overall health.
    Critical Diseases: Diabetes is currently poorly controlled, with recent HbA1c levels indicating high risk.
    Prescription Adherence: The patient should have consumed 60 units of blood pressure medication in the past 2 months but has only reported using 40 units. This suggests potential non-compliance.
    Age Group: The patient is 75 years old, which may affect their medication adherence and overall health management.
    Frequently Reported Symptoms: The patient frequently reports dizziness and fatigue, with the latest occurrences happening in the past week.
    Criticality Flag: High â€“ Due to uncontrolled diabetes, significant non-compliance with blood pressure medication, and recent symptoms indicating possible exacerbation of conditions.

    output should be in the form of passage and add allergies as well.
